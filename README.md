## Dia-a-dia 

 - I'm 21 years old, I'm the father of a beautiful little princess named Maria Cecilia...
 - Today I'm in the health area (but as a pharmacist's assistant, not trained) I want to change my field
 - I've always been very fond of technology, challenges, news, friendships and all that's new
 - Unfortunately I didn't finish high school, but I believe that this is not something that can prevent a new dream from coming true
 - I want to be a full stack dev, I want to learn and improve more soft and hard skills, not only for myself, but also to be able to help someone else who is entering wanting to dive into this world where the possibilities are endless
